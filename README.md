🧠 Life Path – Doctor Appointment Booking System using PHP

Life Path
is a simple web project for the Life Path Psychiatry Clinic, developed using PHP, HTML, and CSS.
The system makes it easy for patients to book appointments with psychiatrists at the clinic electronically. It also helps doctors manage their treatment sessions and organize their time more efficiently.

This system allows patients to browse a list of mental health specialists, select the appropriate doctor, view their available appointment schedules, and then book an appointment at the appropriate time.

Doctors can easily manage their appointments, while the system administrator adds and updates doctor and patient data.

The system has three main roles:

Admin

Doctor

Patient
